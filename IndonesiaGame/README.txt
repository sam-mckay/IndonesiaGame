You were a cave explorer. But something happened and you died. You appear as a ghost above your corpse and see someone standing above you saying "you knew too much" and leaving. You dont know this person or what he is talking about. As a ghost you realize that the whole *relive your memories when you die* is true. With a twist. You see everything in reverse and can not be more than 'x' meters away from your body BUT you can freeze (slow down) the replay while still able to wander around, limited by the whole path thing (we`ll have to figure out how that will work as in specific mechanics).
